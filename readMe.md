## Introduction
Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe is a variant of the classic game that incorporates principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement. The game is designed to provide players with an intuitive understanding of quantum concepts while offering a strategic and fun gaming experience. 

The game is implemented using:
- **Qiskit**: For simulating quantum circuits and operations.
- **Pygame**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: For the AI opponent, which uses quantum strategies to make decisions.

This project was developed as part of a minor project at **Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Purwanchal Campus**.

## Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm
**Alpha-Beta Pruning** is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm, used in decision-making for the AI player. It reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by pruning branches that cannot influence the final decision.

### Key Concepts:
- **Alpha**: The best value that the maximizer (AI) can guarantee.
- **Beta**: The best value that the minimizer (player) can guarantee.
- **Pruning**: Eliminating branches that do not affect the final decision.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. **Max-Value Function**: Evaluates the best move for the AI (maximizer).
2. **Min-Value Function**: Evaluates the best move for the player (minimizer).
3. **Pruning**: If a move is found to be worse than the current best, the branch is pruned.

## Mathematical Formulation
Each tile on the board is represented by a qutrit (quantum trit), which can be in a superposition of states |0‚ü©, |1‚ü©, or |2‚ü©.

### Gates Used:
## 1. Hadamard Gate

- **Creates superposition**:

  \[
  U_H|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle), \quad U_H|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)
  \]

- **Matrix representation**:

  \[
  U_H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
  \]

## 2. CNOT Gate

- **Entangles two qubits**:

  \[
  U_{CNOT} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
  \]

## 3. Pauli X Gate

- **Flips the state of a qubit**:

  \[
  X = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
  \]

## Gameplay and Quantum Circuit Implementation
### Superposition Step
- Players can place an X or O in multiple positions simultaneously using the Hadamard gate.

### Entanglement Step
- Players can entangle two tiles using the CNOT gate, creating a correlation between the states of the tiles.

### Collapse Step
- The superposition is reduced to a single classical state, either |0‚ü© or |1‚ü©, with a 50% probability.
