In the context of Quantum Tic Tac Toe, this circuit could represent 
a quantum move involving two squares (represented by the two qubits).
 The Hadamard gate puts the first square into a superposition of being 
 both X and O, the X gates flip the state of both squares, and the CNOT
  gate entangles the two squares. The actual interpretation may vary 
  depending on the specific rules and representation used in your
 Quantum Tic Tac Toe game.


Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe is a variation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game that incorporates principles from quantum computing. In this version, 
players can use quantum superposition and entanglement to make the game more complex and strategic. Let's discuss the roles of the Hadamard 
gate and CNOT gate in the context of quantum computing and how they apply to Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe:

Hadamard Gate (H gate):

Function: The Hadamard gate is a fundamental quantum gate that creates superposition.
Application in Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe: When a player places an X on the board using the Hadamard gate, it allows the X to exist
 in a superposition of both states (e.g., in two positions simultaneously). This means that the X is not definitively 
 in one spot until measured. The Hadamard gate introduces an element of uncertainty and strategy into the game, as the
  opponent won't know the exact position of the X until they make a measurement.
CNOT Gate (Controlled-NOT gate):

Function: The CNOT gate is a two-qubit gate that entangles two qubits.
Application in Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe: When an O is placed on the board using the CNOT gate, it can be entangled
 with the X already on the board. Entanglement means that the states of the X and O are now correlated, and the
  measurement of one qubit affects the measurement of the other. This introduces a level of connection between 
  the Xs and Os, making the game more complex. The CNOT gate is typically used to create entanglement between
   qubits in quantum algorithms.
In summary, the Hadamard gate is used by the X player to introduce superposition, allowing for the X to be in multiple
 positions at once. The CNOT gate is used by the O player to entangle the O with the existing X, creating a connection
  between them. These quantum gates add a layer of quantum mechanics to the classical Tic-Tac-Toe game, making it more 
  intricate and strategic.
